## Weather Forecast App Documentation

Welcome to the Weather Forecast App documentation. This comprehensive guide aims to provide you with an in-depth understanding of the code and functionality behind the Weather Forecast App, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Overview

The Weather Forecast App serves as a tool for users to obtain weather information for any desired city. By simply inputting the name of the city and clicking on the "Get Weather" button, users can access current weather data, including temperature and description.

### Code Structure

The Weather Forecast App comprises three primary components:

1. **HTML (index.html):** This file defines the structure of the web page, incorporating input fields, buttons, and containers for displaying weather information.
2. **CSS (Style.css):** Here, styles for elements such as background, fonts, input fields, buttons, and weather information display are specified.
3. **JavaScript (Script.js):** This component is responsible for implementing the functionality of fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processing the retrieved data, and displaying it on the web page.

### How to Run

Executing the Weather Forecast App involves the following steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser of your choice.
2. Input the desired city name into the designated field.
3. Click on the "Get Weather" button to trigger the retrieval of weather data for the specified city.

### Detailed Explanation

#### HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) consists of two main sections:

- **Header:** This section contains meta tags, the title of the webpage, as well as links to external CSS and font resources.
- **Body:** This segment is further divided into:
  - **Weather Input Container:** Here, an input field for entering the city name and a button to initiate weather data retrieval are provided.
  - **Main Section:** This area displays the location (city) and current weather information (temperature and description).

#### CSS Styling

In the CSS file (`Style.css`), various styling attributes are defined to enhance the visual appeal of the Weather Forecast App. These include settings for the body background, container design, input fields, buttons, and weather information display.

#### JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript file (`Script.js`) encompasses the following functionalities:

- **Retrieving User Input:** It retrieves the city name entered by the user from the input field.
- **Fetching Weather Data:** The script constructs an API URL using the entered city name and API key, subsequently fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the `fetch()` method.
- **Displaying Weather Information:** Upon successful retrieval, the script dynamically updates the HTML content with the retrieved weather data, including the city name, temperature, description, and current date.
